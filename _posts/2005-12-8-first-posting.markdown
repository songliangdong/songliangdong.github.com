After various failed attempts at blogging (including two when I was a Sabbatical Officer at UCL Union), I'll now try again. I am not sure I'll say too much about myself, as I don't really think I'm that interesting! But I'll link to things that are interesting when I find them. Blogging is another great distraction in life... something that'll lead me down the road to a third-class degree.
