Microsoft have rebranded the next version of MSN Messenger as Windows Live Messenger. Information is at <a href="http://ideas.live.com/programpage.aspx?versionId=0eccd94b-eb48-497c-8e60-c6313f7ebb73">Windows Live Ideas</a>.

Much like with the birth of <a href="http://gmail.google.com/">Google's GMail</a>, download is currently by invitation only. I have a few invitations to spare, so if you're interested, leave a message on this blog.
